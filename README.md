## About This Project

This repository contains a technical and pedagogical exercise developed for UC ML I (Machine Learning I). The goal is to document the complete ML lifecycle - from problem definition to deployment - while comparing two implementation approaches:

- **Python**: For ML training, experimentation, and rapid prototyping
- **Go**: For production inference serving with emphasis on performance

### Why This Structure?

Rather than just producing working code, this project emphasizes:
- [ ] **Documentation-first approach**: Every decision is justified and documented
- [ ] **Reproducibility**: Anyone should be able to follow and replicate the process
- [ ] **Real-world methodology**: Following industry best practices (8-phase ML lifecycle)
- [ ] **Language comparison**: Practical insights on Python vs Go trade-offs

### Why a Fictional Company?

Using RoboSense Labs as a fictional business case provides:
- Realistic constraints (cost, latency, accuracy requirements)
- Clear success metrics (not just "maximize accuracy")
- Context for technical decisions (why this matters beyond academia)
